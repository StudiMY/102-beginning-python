Welcome to Python For Beginners 102 documentation!
==================================================

This is a continuation from `Python 101 <https://github.com/StudiMY/101-beginning-python>`_.

Two things are crucial in mastering programming - Data Structure and Algorithm. 

What You'll Learn
-----------------
.. topic:: Idea #1 - Data Structure

    Think about it, if we know how to organize data in the most efficient way for a particular problem, we have already solve half of the problem. The other half is how to process it to return expected result (the algorithm part). In this topic, you'll learn some popular Data Structures in Python and its behaviour. The idea is to learn about data structures so you can select the right one to solve a specific problem. There's no one size fits all.

.. topic:: Idea #2 - Looping

    When we learn how data is organized in various data structures, we'll typically need to loop through them. Looping is also another type of control flow.
